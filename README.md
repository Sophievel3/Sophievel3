### WELCOME ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ With 6 years of professional experience, I have developed a sharp expertise in:
    - Quantitative Finance related to the credit finance area (until now I have only one experience in market finance, but I am interested on it),
    - the development and training of mathematical models, and
    - Data Science.

ðŸŒ± Understanding the requirements and challenges of Quantitative Analysis and Data Science, I always try to highlight an ability to adapt and team working, enriched with an attentive, rigorous and efficient character.


ðŸŒ±Here you will find some of the models that I have made, and that portray my skills and knowledge in the field of Data Science.

ðŸŒ±Surely the codes can be further optimized. Nevertheless, they were done such that they respect all what was requested to me at the time.

ðŸŒ±Most of the documents are in French, as they were made in France for study purposes or local clients. If you need any translation, I remain at your disposal.
